# Gwen Assignment

## Overview
This project performs data analysis and visualization using Python. It utilizes libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn for handling and processing data.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.8+). Then, install the required dependencies using:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you haven't created a `requirements.txt`, you can install the necessary libraries individually:

```sh
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage
Run the script using:

```sh
python script.py
```

Ensure your dataset is in the correct format and located in the appropriate directory as specified in the script.

## Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required:
- `pandas` - For data manipulation
- `matplotlib` - For data visualization
- `scikit-learn` - For machine learning and data preprocessing

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter module import errors, ensure all dependencies are installed using:

```sh
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

If you are using a virtual environment, activate it before running the script:

```sh
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
```
